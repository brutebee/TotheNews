## McDonald's Restaurant Reports Cyber Security Issues

This is a web page that provides an audio player with a play/pause button to listen to cyber security issue reports from McDonald's restaurants. The page is designed to be responsive and uses WaveSurfer.js to create an interactive audio visualization.

### Demo Page

You can access the demo page for this project by visiting the following link:

[**Demo Page: McDonald's Restaurant Reports Cyber Security Issues**](https://brutebee.github.io/TotheNews/)

The demo page allows you to experience the audio player in action and visualize the audio waveform.
### Features

- Audio Player: The page includes an audio player that allows users to play and pause an audio file containing the cyber security issue reports from McDonald's restaurants.
- Play/Pause Button: The player features a play/pause button represented by an icon of a "play" symbol. Clicking the button starts or pauses the audio playback.
- Waveform Visualization: The audio waveform visualization is displayed below the play/pause button, providing users with a visual representation of the audio content.
- Interaction Events: The audio player responds to user interactions. When users manually play or pause the audio by clicking on the waveform or using the play/pause button, the player updates the play/pause button's icon accordingly.

### How to Use

1. Access the Web Page: To use this audio player, access the HTML file on a web browser that supports modern JavaScript modules.
2. Play/Pause Audio: Click on the "play" button (represented by a "play" icon). This will start or pause the audio playback.
3. Audio Visualization: The audio waveform visualization will be displayed below the play/pause button, showing the audio's amplitude over time.

### Prerequisites

- Web Browser: Ensure that you have a modern web browser that supports JavaScript modules.
- WaveSurfer.js: The audio visualization is powered by WaveSurfer.js, which is included in the page using a script tag from the provided URL (https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@7/dist/wavesurfer.esm.js).

### Important Notes

- Audio Source: The audio file is loaded from the URL 'media/toronto-news.mp3'. Make sure that the server hosting this page has the audio file at the specified URL or update it to the correct audio file path.
- Styling: The page references a CSS file 'style.css' for styling. Make sure to include the CSS file or adjust the styling as per your project's requirements.
- Icons: The play and pause button icons are expected to be in the "media" folder and named 'play.png' and 'pause.png', respectively.
