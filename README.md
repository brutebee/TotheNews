Attention, this is not a drill! Evacuation, now! Do not use the elevators!

Imagine you walk into work, you press Control, ALT, DELETE, you see this!
A message displaying random digits giving you instructions to visit some Dark Web Site. What do you do?

Well, this is what happened to McDonald's Restaurants this Sunday morning in Toronto GTA, while thousands of Canadians starve together! The entire McDonald's Network has been shut down! by some sort of malware virus!

We're here now at the Dundas Square McDonald's restaurant HQ, and here are the news! Everything has been encrypted, and there is no decryption available!! At least, that's what the IT folks said.
All employees are running back and forth like there is nothing else they could do! I wonder how Daniel is gonna go get their Big Mac now!

Back to you, Rachel!

2. Play/Pause Audio: Click on the "play" button (represented by a "play" icon). This will start or pause the audio playback.
3. Audio Visualization: The audio waveform visualization will be displayed below the play/pause button, showing the audio's amplitude over time.

### Prerequisites

- Web Browser: Ensure that you have a modern web browser that supports JavaScript modules.
- WaveSurfer.js: The audio visualization is powered by WaveSurfer.js, which is included in the page using a script tag from the provided URL (https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@7/dist/wavesurfer.esm.js).

### Important Notes

- Audio Source: The audio file is loaded from the URL 'media/toronto-news.mp3'. Make sure that the server hosting this page has the audio file at the specified URL or update it to the correct audio file path.
- Styling: The page references a CSS file 'style.css' for styling. Make sure to include the CSS file or adjust the styling as per your project's requirements.
